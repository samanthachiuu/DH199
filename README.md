# DH199 Project: User Experience Design in Exploring UCLA History 
# Samantha Chiu

## Project Overview

### Project Description:
In this project, I would like to propose the ux design for the walkthrough of UCLA architectures in history. I am
motivated to do this project because I want to take advantage of the time I have left as an undergrad to
create something for UCLA that will be there forever to commemorate the amazing people who have built
these buildings and understand why these buildings are called what they are called. The location-based
exploration of the hidden or text-documented history of UCLA can retell the significant meaning to the
visitors and the prospect students of how UCLA contributed to the various areas of Humanities, Art and filming,
Science and Engineering, and Medical and Biological Sciences. The important building I will be exploring is
Haines Hall because throughout my career at UCLA, my main building was Haines and I have a connection
to it. To produce an interactive prototype of a mobile app as a proof of concept.

--------------------

### Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of my project is a map-directory and walkthrough of UCLA architures in history, specifically focusing on Haines Hall. I will adopt an interative user-centered design process using methods such as conducting user research, creating personas/scenarios, and proposing multiple versions of the wireflow (low-fidelity) and interactive prototype (high-fidelity) for usability testing.

### Literature Review:
Mobile learning has become an effective way to educate individuals in the 21st century. We are constantly on our phones and spending most of our days browsing through the web on our little screens. From the book, Mobile Design Pattern Gallery: UI patterns for smartphone apps, Neil goes through different design techniques that can improve mobile applications. He states that having an interactive preview in applications where users can zoom in and feel connected to the information can help with the design of mobile apps.Therefore, technology has become something we can work with to learn and gain knowledge. "The digital has rapidly become a significant medium in the ‘nexus of historical meanings and experiences’" (Smith, Lewi, Nichols, 2018). Smith, Lewi, and Nichols reflect on the design of a mobile app that is supposed to share the history of Port Melbourne through collaboration from other’s knowledge of the history. In their paper ‘PastPort’: Reflections on the Design of a Mobile App for Citizen Heritage in Port Melbourne, one of the most outstanding things they noticed was that they hoped the application would focus on a smaller locality so that the individuals sharing historical information would also focus on a certain part of the city and that there would be a higher interest in sharing information. People can become overwhelmed with too much information if the area of focus is so broad. Additionally, Smith, Lewi, and Nichols insists that researchers and designers take advantage of the technology we have today. They explain the importance of using interactive maps and contemporary digital technologies such as pinned map locations, so users are more inclined to use it. Especially with technology constantly improving and evolving, we need to keep updating the different technologies used for any mobile application.
 
Understanding the history of architecture can be difficult when individuals are not provided with accurate techniques and skills to visualize the buildings. Allais explains in the chapter of his book RENDERING: On Experience and Experiments that one of the most important aspects of allowing others to be engaged in history is to render the buildings and structures. In order to render, one must be able to visualize them through images. Images are a great way for others to see the story visually and understand the deep history of many architectural buildings. In the book Visual Spatial Enquiry - Diagrams and Metaphors for Architects and Spatial Thinkers, Creagh and McGann explain the usefulness of spatial research in comprehending architecture. When there is a complex concept, it is easier to visualize through an image. This idea of visualizing space can help individuals with new and innovative propositions that can reshape the relational settings. Not only do individuals have more blank space to innovate, but it also looks more aesthetic for the eye to look at. In spatial research, one of the methods used is to synthesize complex concepts into blank space and eventually turned into a succinct picture. Creagh and McGann explain the three most important concepts for editors with architectural backgrounds are seeing, doing, and making space. Especially when individuals are looking at an interactive map, they can see the overall concept of the map, do the task that they want to do, and make space on the map to see it.  
 
Other than visualizing space through an application, interactive models are also as important. From the book, Mixed-methods research: A new approach to evaluating the motivation and satisfaction of university students using advanced visual technologies, Fonseca, Redondo, and Villagrasa explain the usefulness of interactive tools that signify 3D architectural modeling. The authors talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using this type of technology to evaluate different types of architecture throughout history. Especially with the dense information about historical facts on different types of buildings, it can be helpful for users to visualize this storyline through interactive tools. This can allow the users to become more immersive with the information and feel more connected to the history. The images of the maps have to look realistic for the users to imagine themselves standing in front of the building. The interactive model can also help individuals become more technologically advanced by understanding how to use these tools. In the book chapter, Context-Architecture and the Genius of Place, Parry talks about how the importance of context of the architecture must be taken into account in every step of the design process. Especially in Chapter 3 Simultaneity, he talks about what happens when two events happen simultaneously and how context becomes an important aspect that we have to consider. In general, context is an important concept in any form of history because people are understanding the history from the authors point of view. For example, context of what is going on within the time that people might be using the app is as important. Users will be more inclined to use and understand the history of architecture when it is relatable to their lives and their generation.
 
I also looked at a similar mobile application, London Architecture Guide, where it allowed users to look at different architectures in London. The main screen is an interactive map for users to scroll through. However, I wish that there was a satellite view of the map to look more realistic and eye-appealing. If you zoom in, there are many blue dots to show the different architectures, as I think it would have been better to color coordinate the different types of architectures so users know the difference. I liked that the application gives the users the option to choose through the architectures through a list. I believe that the history of the architecture itself is quite wordy as if I was a tourist using this application, I would like to read more historical fun facts about the buildings rather than a history report. Overall, I feel the application has a lot of features for individuals to use, but the user interface and design can be improved to better attract the users.

## User Research Planning 

### Activity:
The main activity of my project would support the users to understand the history of the main architectures, like Royce Hall, at UCLA. According to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, some specific users, like UCLA students would need the social belonging involved in this activity. The “social belonging” is the third level of the human needs of Maslow’s pyramid and is related to understanding the history of the different architectures at UCLA. Depending on the type of user, one can feel a sense of belonging after understanding the history because they can be a student there themselves. However, if users were visitors like parents or friends or even potential students, they might strive for a sense of connectedness to their personal lives so they can feel psychologically closer to important buildings that represent UCLA. It can potentially increase their experience at UCLA and create a positive memory towards UCLA brand identity. They can also simply enjoy the beauty of the different parts of the physical building itself and its meaning with it. 

------------------

### Solutions:
The current or traditional solution that would satisfy the needs of the users is researching what you want to know about UCLA on your own through Google or the school website so you know more about the history. You can also walk through campus on your own and try to find monuments that provide some history about the buildings. Some limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology is a location-based tracker where it can automatically track where you are on campus and provide immediate fun facts on the building. Therefore, it is more convenient and more efficient to get around campus, while learning about the history and feel more connected to the school. 

-----------------------

### Target Users:
The different types of users that might use this app include college students, high school students preparing to come to college, tourists, and professors or staff that work at UCLA. I want to focus mainly on college students and prospective students because I feel that the app would benefit them more. They would use the app when they are walking around campus and want to learn more about the different architectures. The goal of the user is to feel more connected to UCLA and know more about the history of how it got to where it is today. 

---------------------

### Context and Research Method:
The research method I decided to do is a phone interview with one of the campus tour guides at UCLA. Campus tour guides are well-trained students that tour prospective students and parents around UCLA and tell them about the history and fun facts of UCLA. In this virtual phone interview, I will be directly asking questions about giving tours at UCLA and the type of information said on the tours. I hope for the interview to be around 30 minutes and I will be doing it in my room around noon time. I will also be having interviews through text message to different users so I can guage the interests of the different users. Additionally, I will be looking at the UCLA virtual tour on their website for an observation. I will use the virtual tour like I am a prospective student and have never been on the campus or know anything about UCLA. Then I will jot down notes on what I noticed and observed through the virtual tour.

### Findings & Analysis

** Keyword Finding** | 
-------------------|
![Keyword Finding](<img width="900" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 6 39 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623131/81761968-4904d680-9480-11ea-8aaf-db8cf0eba063.png">)
<img width="422" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-12 at 6 39 30 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623131/81761975-4b673080-9480-11ea-8549-c67f76accabd.png">

To analyze my data, I decided to do a keyword finding by looking through all of my interviews. I listed all the important keywords and grouped them into sections that I felt went together. From the groupings, I found 5 few categories.

- Flexibility
- Detailed Design & Appearance 
- Context & Experience
- Process of History
- Feeling Connected & Included 

-----------------------------------



Through my research, I found that users needs are the accessibility to the application, the connection to others and themselves, and the importance of an interactive and in-person walk through of the campus. Some design requirements would include an interactive and personable map where users are able to feel like they are actually on campus exploring the buildings, and features that allow users to filter the information to the specific user wants and needs. 

-------------------------

### Reflection
Throughout this process, I learned the techniques in conducting a phone interview for my research. I had trouble thinking about different questions to ask in the beginning because I wanted to make sure I asked good questions. The interviews went really well and I noticed that your script is not exactly what you have to say. As the interview went on, I noticed I changed the script as the interview flowed so it was natural. Sometimes I changed up the questions because I felt it was unnecessary to ask or if they already answered it in another question. I learned that when interviewing participants, anything can happen. You can never know exactly what the participant will say and you as the interviewer have to be ready to ask questions that may not be in your script but within the context of the interview. What I would do differently next time is to have more focused tasks for the participant to do because I feel as though it was quite repetitive. I could also potentially add one more task to test another aspect within learning about how people might learn about the history of UCLA. I would also hope to have more time to interview more people.

### Isabella's Architecture Tour with Interactive Map
Isabella is coming back to UCLA for an alumni panel. She takes off early from work to walk around the school and explore what has changed in the past year and a half since she’s been a student. As she walks by Royce Hall, she stops and admires the beautiful architecture of the building. She thinks back to all the times when she was a student and walked by Royce but have not fully enjoyed all the designs and history that is in that building. Because she is a graphic designer that designs different parts of buildings, she can’t help but wonder who built Royce and why this designer decided to build the building in this way. She tries to look up some basic information but all it gives her is Jstor scholarly articles that she does not want to read through and comprehend. Instead, she can now use the interactive map on the app and it will give you the option to click find your location, search up a specific building you want to learn about, or start a complete historical architecture tour. Isabella would first tap on the find her location and immediately it will show a first person view of what she is looking at through the app. Since she is standing in front of Royce, she will just tap the building and it will provide a summary of the historical facts of the architecture and fun facts about the building. She clicks the live version to get more of a personable tour of the architecture. 

--------------------------------

### Isabella's Experience and Activity Feed
Isabella learns a lot of historical information about the architecture of Royce Hall and is very satisfied. However, she wants to have more of a personal connection to the building and other people that have encountered this building. She can now go to the geotag icon and search bar will pop up. Isabella types Royce Hall and it brings up an image and a public discussion forum of how others have experienced this building. People can share their stories and comments that they want others to hear about too, and feel a real connection to how people spend their time there enjoying the art of the building. Isabella will also be able to leave her own story and pictures to mark the date and time when she has encountered the building. 

----------------------------------

### Isabella's Directional Map with Filters
Isabella checks her email and realizes that her alumni panel changed their location last minute. She sees that the new location of the panel is somewhere she has not heard of before called Bombshelter. Usually, Isabella would look it up on Google to see where it is and find any information about the building. She would realize that it is in the south side of campus that she is not very familiar with. She gets frustrated because she is running late and expected herself to know UCLA better. It would have taken her an extra 10 to 15 minutes to find and get to the building. The rest of the alumni also had the same problem as her. However, now she can use the interactive map and search up the name of the building. Isabella would type Bombshelter and get step-by-step instructions on how to get there in the least amount of time from where you are located. It can also let you filter which route you want to go - for example, walking a more scenic route if you aren’t in a time constraint.

The user's overall feedback is to add be more clear with my buttons because they were unsure where to tap or where to go. Also, I should be more clear with some of the words, such as "Message us!". There were suggestions on adding incentives for users within the geo-tag section where users can get free vouchers for things to do at UCLA. Additionally, I should work on my filters for my directions sections so it is clear to the user which button to select and how many.
