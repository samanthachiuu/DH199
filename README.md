# DH199 Project: Exploring UCLA History 
## Samantha Chiu 

### Project Description:
In this project, I would like to propose the ux design for the walkthrough of UCLA architectures in history. I am
motivated to do this project because I want to take advantage of the time I have left as an undergrad to
create something for UCLA that will be there forever to commemorate the amazing people who have built
these buildings and understand why these buildings are called what they are called. The location-based
exploration of the hidden or text-documented history of UCLA can retell the significant meaning to the
visitors and the prospect students of how UCLA contributed to the various areas of Humanities, Art and filming,
Science and Engineering, and Medical and Biological Sciences. The important building I will be exploring is
Haines Hall because throughout my career at UCLA, my main building was Haines and I have a connection
to it. To produce an interactive prototype of a mobile app as a proof of concept, I will adopt an iterative
user-centered design process. As methods, I will conduct user research and create personas/scenario, and
propose multiple versions of wireflow (low-fidelity) and interactive prototype (high-fidelity) for usability testing.
