# DH199 Project: Exploring UCLA History 
## Samantha Chiu 

### Project Description:
In this project, I would like to propose the ux design for the walkthrough of UCLA architectures in history. I am
motivated to do this project because I want to take advantage of the time I have left as an undergrad to
create something for UCLA that will be there forever to commemorate the amazing people who have built
these buildings and understand why these buildings are called what they are called. The location-based
exploration of the hidden or text-documented history of UCLA can retell the significant meaning to the
visitors and the prospect students of how UCLA contributed to the various areas of Humanities, Art and filming,
Science and Engineering, and Medical and Biological Sciences. The important building I will be exploring is
Haines Hall because throughout my career at UCLA, my main building was Haines and I have a connection
to it. To produce an interactive prototype of a mobile app as a proof of concept.

--------------------

### Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of my project is a map-directory and walkthrough of UCLA architures in history, specifically focusing on Haines Hall. I will adopt an interative user-centered design process using methods such as conducting user research, creating personas/scenarios, and proposing multiple versions of the wireflow (low-fidelity) and interactive prototype (high-fidelity) for usability testing.
