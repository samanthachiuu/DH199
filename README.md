# DH199 Project: User Experience Design in Exploring UCLA History 
**Samantha Chiu** 

## Project Overview

### Project Description:
In this project, I would like to propose the ux design for the walkthrough of UCLA architectures in history. I am
motivated to do this project because I want to take advantage of the time I have left as an undergrad to
create something for UCLA that will be there forever to commemorate the amazing people who have built
these buildings and understand why these buildings are called what they are called. The location-based
exploration of the hidden or text-documented history of UCLA can retell the significant meaning to the
visitors and the prospect students of how UCLA contributed to the various areas of Humanities, Art and filming,
Science and Engineering, and Medical and Biological Sciences. The important building I will be exploring is
Haines Hall because throughout my career at UCLA, my main building was Haines and I have a connection
to it. To produce an interactive prototype of a mobile app as a proof of concept.

--------------------

### Expected Outcome:
The expected outcome of my project is a map-directory and walkthrough of UCLA architures in history, specifically focusing on Haines Hall. I will adopt an interative user-centered design process using methods such as conducting user research, creating personas/scenarios, and proposing multiple versions of the wireflow (low-fidelity) and interactive prototype (high-fidelity) for usability testing.

### Proposal Topic / Keywords:
*location-based map, design, engagement, history of architecture, user experience* 

### Literature Review
Mobile learning has become an effective way to educate individuals in the 21st century. We are constantly on our phones and spending most of our days browsing through the web on our little screens. From the book, Mobile Design Pattern Gallery: UI patterns for smartphone apps, Neil goes through different design techniques that can improve mobile applications. He states that having an interactive preview in applications where users can zoom in and feel connected to the information can help with the design of mobile apps.Therefore, technology has become something we can work with to learn and gain knowledge. "The digital has rapidly become a significant medium in the ‘nexus of historical meanings and experiences’" (Smith, Lewi, Nichols, 2018). Smith, Lewi, and Nichols reflect on the design of a mobile app that is supposed to share the history of Port Melbourne through collaboration from other’s knowledge of the history. In their paper ‘PastPort’: Reflections on the Design of a Mobile App for Citizen Heritage in Port Melbourne, one of the most outstanding things they noticed was that they hoped the application would focus on a smaller locality so that the individuals sharing historical information would also focus on a certain part of the city and that there would be a higher interest in sharing information. People can become overwhelmed with too much information if the area of focus is so broad. Additionally, Smith, Lewi, and Nichols insists that researchers and designers take advantage of the technology we have today. They explain the importance of using interactive maps and contemporary digital technologies such as pinned map locations, so users are more inclined to use it. Especially with technology constantly improving and evolving, we need to keep updating the different technologies used for any mobile application.
 
Understanding the history of architecture can be difficult when individuals are not provided with accurate techniques and skills to visualize the buildings. Allais explains in the chapter of his book RENDERING: On Experience and Experiments that one of the most important aspects of allowing others to be engaged in history is to render the buildings and structures. In order to render, one must be able to visualize them through images. Images are a great way for others to see the story visually and understand the deep history of many architectural buildings. In the book Visual Spatial Enquiry - Diagrams and Metaphors for Architects and Spatial Thinkers, Creagh and McGann explain the usefulness of spatial research in comprehending architecture. When there is a complex concept, it is easier to visualize through an image. This idea of visualizing space can help individuals with new and innovative propositions that can reshape the relational settings. Not only do individuals have more blank space to innovate, but it also looks more aesthetic for the eye to look at. In spatial research, one of the methods used is to synthesize complex concepts into blank space and eventually turned into a succinct picture. Creagh and McGann explain the three most important concepts for editors with architectural backgrounds are seeing, doing, and making space. Especially when individuals are looking at an interactive map, they can see the overall concept of the map, do the task that they want to do, and make space on the map to see it.  
 
Other than visualizing space through an application, interactive models are also as important. From the book, Mixed-methods research: A new approach to evaluating the motivation and satisfaction of university students using advanced visual technologies, Fonseca, Redondo, and Villagrasa explain the usefulness of interactive tools that signify 3D architectural modeling. The authors talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using this type of technology to evaluate different types of architecture throughout history. Especially with the dense information about historical facts on different types of buildings, it can be helpful for users to visualize this storyline through interactive tools. This can allow the users to become more immersive with the information and feel more connected to the history. The images of the maps have to look realistic for the users to imagine themselves standing in front of the building. The interactive model can also help individuals become more technologically advanced by understanding how to use these tools. In the book chapter, Context-Architecture and the Genius of Place, Parry talks about how the importance of context of the architecture must be taken into account in every step of the design process. Especially in Chapter 3 Simultaneity, he talks about what happens when two events happen simultaneously and how context becomes an important aspect that we have to consider. In general, context is an important concept in any form of history because people are understanding the history from the authors point of view. For example, context of what is going on within the time that people might be using the app is as important. Users will be more inclined to use and understand the history of architecture when it is relatable to their lives and their generation.
 
I also looked at a similar mobile application, London Architecture Guide, where it allowed users to look at different architectures in London. The main screen is an interactive map for users to scroll through. However, I wish that there was a satellite view of the map to look more realistic and eye-appealing. If you zoom in, there are many blue dots to show the different architectures, as I think it would have been better to color coordinate the different types of architectures so users know the difference. I liked that the application gives the users the option to choose through the architectures through a list. I believe that the history of the architecture itself is quite wordy as if I was a tourist using this application, I would like to read more historical fun facts about the buildings rather than a history report. Overall, I feel the application has a lot of features for individuals to use, but the user interface and design can be improved to better attract the users.
