# DH199 Project: User Experience Design in Exploring UCLA History 
## Samantha Chiu 

### Project Description:
In this project, I would like to propose the ux design for the walkthrough of UCLA architectures in history. I am
motivated to do this project because I want to take advantage of the time I have left as an undergrad to
create something for UCLA that will be there forever to commemorate the amazing people who have built
these buildings and understand why these buildings are called what they are called. The location-based
exploration of the hidden or text-documented history of UCLA can retell the significant meaning to the
visitors and the prospect students of how UCLA contributed to the various areas of Humanities, Art and filming,
Science and Engineering, and Medical and Biological Sciences. The important building I will be exploring is
Haines Hall because throughout my career at UCLA, my main building was Haines and I have a connection
to it. To produce an interactive prototype of a mobile app as a proof of concept.

--------------------

### Expected Outcome
The expected outcome of my project is a map-directory and walkthrough of UCLA architures in history, specifically focusing on Haines Hall. I will adopt an interative user-centered design process using methods such as conducting user research, creating personas/scenarios, and proposing multiple versions of the wireflow (low-fidelity) and interactive prototype (high-fidelity) for usability testing.

### Literature Review 

**Research Question:**
How does the user experience design of a location-based map help engage users to increase their understanding in the history of architecture?   

**Proposal Topic / Keywords:** *location-based map, design, engagement, history of architecture, user experience* 

Mobile learning has become an effective way to educate individuals in the 21st century. We are constantly on our phones and spending most of our days browsing through the web on our little screens. From the book *Mobile Design: Pattern Gallery*, it goes through different design techniques that can improve mobile applications. Neil states that having an interactive preview in applications where users can zoom in and feel connected to the information can help with the design of mobile apps. 

Therefore, technology has become something we can work with to learn and gain knowledge. "The digital has rapidly become a significant medium in the ‘nexus of historical meanings and experiences’" (Smith, Lewi, Nichols, 2018). Smith, Lewi, and Nichols reflect on the design of a mobile app that is supposed to share the history of Port Melborne through the sharing of history from others. One of the big things they noticed was that they hoped the application would focus on a smaller lcoality so that the individuals sharing historical information would also focus on a certain part of the city and that there would be a higher interest in sharing information. People can become overwhelmed with information if the area of focus is so broad. Additionally, Smith, Lewi, and Nichols insists that we take advantage of the technology we have today. They explain the importance of using interactive maps and contemporary digital technlogies such as pinned map locations. Especially with technology constantly improving and evolving, we need to keep updating the different technologies used for any mobile application. 

Understanding the history of architecture can be difficult when individuals are not provided with the accurate techniques and skills to visualize the buildings. Allais explains in his chapter of his book *RENDERING: On Experience and Experiments* that one of the most important aspects of allowing others to be engaged in the history is to render the buildings and structures. In order to render, one must be able to visualize them through images.  

In the book *Visual Spatial Enquiry - Diagrams and Metaphors for Architects and Spatial Thinkers*, Creagh and McGann explain the usefulness of spatial research in comprehending architecture. When there is a complex concept, it is easier to visualize through an image. This idea of visualizing space can help individuals with new and innovative propositions that can reshape the relational settings. Not only do individuals have more space to innovate, but it also looks more aesthetic for the eye to look at. 

The usefulness of interactive tools that signify 3D architectual modeling - 
Fonseca, Redondo, and Villagrasa talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using this type of technology to evaluate different types of architecture throughout history. Especially with the dense information about historical facts on different types of buildings, it can be helpful for users to visualize this storyline through interactive tools. 
This can allow the users to become more immersive with the information and feel more connected to the history. 

Importance of context of the architecture must be taken into account in every step of the design process. 

Context of what is going on within the time that people might be using the app is as important. Users will be more inclined to use and understand the history of architecture when it is relatable to their lives and their generation. You want the information to be relative to the traditional media.
